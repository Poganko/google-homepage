### Tips

- DON’T BE A PERFECTIONIST! You’re just trying to make it look like google.com, not actually function like it and it doesn’t have to be spaced exactly the same way to the pixel. Any dropdown menus or form submissions or hover-highlighting should be ignored.
- USE GOOGLE! You’ll probably run into roadblocks where you can’t figure out how to do something so do what all good devs do… Google it!
- Now is a good time [to set up the live server extension](https://youtu.be/mGORIVStWWc) in VSCode, if you haven’t already. This extension will save you from the hassle of refreshing the browser window repeatedly to see changes made in your code and will automatically load the most recent change in the browser window.
- If you’re frustrated with trying to get buttons or inputs to style the way you want (for instance, they seem to just not respond to any styles), look into the CSS property `-webkit-appearance: none;` or `-moz-appearance` if you’re using Firefox.
